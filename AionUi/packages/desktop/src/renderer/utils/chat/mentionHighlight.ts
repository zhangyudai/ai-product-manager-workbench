 * Which mention tokens the send box should paint.
 *
 * The rule is "coloured ⇔ a reference is actually attached", and it is a
 * correction rather than a new feature. The overlay used to paint every match of
 * the `@…` text pattern, so typing `@config.json` by hand looked exactly like
 * picking it from the dropdown — while only the pick attaches a `ChatFileRef`.
 * A real user read the colour as confirmation, sent the message, and the agent
 * received no `[[AION_FILES]]` block at all. The colour was the only signal, and
 * it was not telling the truth.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function, separate from the 1900-line send box, because the
 * matching rules differ per lane and are easy to get subtly wrong.
