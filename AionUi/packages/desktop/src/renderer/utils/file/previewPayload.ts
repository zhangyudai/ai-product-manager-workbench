 *
 * 1. `size` decides whether the content is read at all. Previously each entry
 *    point truncated differently (or not at all), which is what allowed an
 *    oversized file to be opened partially and then saved back — destroying the
 *    part that was never read.
 * 2. `lastModified` becomes the save-time conflict-detection condition. Fetching
 *    it here is what makes "opened but never saved" tabs protected; splitting it
 *    into a second request would double the round trips for no gain.
 *
 * Throws when the file cannot be stat'd (missing / unreadable), which every
 * caller already handles as its own flavour of "file not available".
 *
 * # Why the limit is read here and nowhere else
 *
 * The text ceiling is a user setting, and it is read **once, at open time**, then
 * carried on the tab as `thresholdBytes`. Reading it at render time instead would
 * let changing the setting reclassify tabs already on screen: a file being edited
 * would flip to "too large, open it in a system editor" mid-edit, and lowering the
 * limit would strand content the user had not saved. Snapshotting keeps the
 * documented semantics — **a changed limit applies to newly opened tabs only**.
 *
 * A failed settings read is not an error here: it falls back to the default
 * ceiling, because refusing to open a file over an unreadable preference would be a
 * worse outcome than gating it at 1 MB.
 *
 * @param fileRef     Identity to read — resolution to a path stays in the backend.
 * @param contentType Decides the read encoding and which ceiling applies.
